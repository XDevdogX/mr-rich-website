		<h1>About Mr. Rich</h1>

        <p>
            Mr. Rich (formerly known as Fnaf Rich) is a Youtuber who has been uploading plush content for years
			for people to enjoy. 
        </p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            The Mr. Rich channel itself was created in 2017, the origins of Mr. Rich go beyond the channel itself.
            The first plush video ever created by Mr. Rich was recorded around mid 2017, and was crudely
            recorded in one shot on an old iPod Touch. The original video was never uploaded.
            <br><br>
            Shortly following, multiple videos were recorded and uploaded to his brother's Youtube channel.
            These videos were recorded on an iPhone 6, and now used separate video clips for each scene.
            The videos featured some Nintendo characters, and other random plushies. Unfortunately, all these
            videos have since been deleted, and are lost to time. The same goes for every video recorded before
            the first to utilize FNAF (Five Nights at Freddy's) characters.
            <br><br>
            After the first few videos, the Mr. Rich channel was officially created October 29, 2017. The channel 
			has gone through multiple renames, with the first rename being <strong>Super Mario Rich</strong>, based 
			off the Youtube channel <strong>Super Mario Richie</strong>. It was eventually renamed to <strong>Fnaf 
			Rich</strong> after the channel switched to primarily using FNAF plushies for the characters. This name 
			was used for years up until recently, when the channel was finally renamed to <strong>Mr. Rich</strong> 
			right before it reached 100k subscribers.
            <br><br>
            The first ever video to utilize FNAF plushies was named "Freddy's New Home" and was uploaded on December
            27, 2017. From this point on, the FNAF characters became a staple of the channel. Over the years, many
			videos would be uploaded, with the most popular video reaching <strong>4.4 million views</strong>!
			<br><br>
			As of today, the Mr. Rich crew consists of four members.
